        <li>12 ounces linguine</li>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon, plus wedges for serving</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="shrimp steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="shrimp-paragraphs">
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the 
            linguine and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1 cup 
            cooking water, then drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, season the shrimp with salt. Heat the olive 
            oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the 
            garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic 
            is just golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the shrimp 
            and cook, stirring occasionally, until pink and just 
            cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the 
            shrimp to a plate. Add the wine and lemon juice to the 
            skillet and simmer until slightly reduced, 
            2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return the shrimp and any juices from the plate to the 
            skillet along with the linguine, butter and 1/2 cup of 
            the reserved cooking water. Continue to cook, tossing, 
            until the butter is melted and the shrimp is hot, about 
            2 minutes, adding more of the reserved cooking water as 
            needed. Season with salt; stir in the parsley. Serve 
            with lemon wedges. </li>
