        <!-- Steps to make the lasagna-->
        <h2 class="las steps">Steps:</h2>
        <ol class="las-paragraphs">
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion
                , and garlic over medium heat until well browned.
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato 
                sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel
                seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, 
                and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for 
                about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a 
                boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 
                8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with 
                cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta 
                cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 
                teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in 
                the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 
                noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 
                one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 
                a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 
                cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle 
                with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and 
                top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray 
                foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil 
                does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove 
                foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool 
                for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
